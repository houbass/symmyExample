I have prepared simply landing page with product catalog and detail page, with usage of
Ant design library and TanStack Query.
I also implemented easy search input which filter items and also store values to
URL params, so it can be easily shared. There is also dynamic router for product detail
page + automatic redirecting if the page does not exist. I also demonstrate a quick input test.
As a next steps of developing I would focus to the following:

- pictures optimalization (adding skeletons)
- SEO
- PWA
- meta data (for social preview)
- search input debounce
- redux or another state managament library
- localization (translations)
- virtualization or pagination of cards (if there would be many of them)
- testing
